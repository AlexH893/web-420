Design of Web APIs
Ch1

An API is a web interface for software

Web APIs turn software into reusable bricks that can be used over a network with 
the HTTP protocol.

A point where two 
systems, subjects, organizations, and so forth meet and interact

Just as we (human beings) use an application’s UI to interact with it, that application 
can use another application through its programming interface.

Private & public APIs

Public APIs are proposed as a service or as a product by others; you don’t build them, 
you don’t install them, you don’t run them—you only use them


A private API is one you 
build for yourself: only applications created by you or people inside your team, department, or company use it. In this case, you are your own API provider and API consumer.


Developers expect APIs to be helpful and simple, just like any interface 
they have to interact with. That is why API design matters


The design of an API must conceal implementation details (what actually happens). 

An API with a bad design may leave users frustrated or might be unwilling to use it altogether. Sometimes users have no choice but to use them anyway, such as at companies
